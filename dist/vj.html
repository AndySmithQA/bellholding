            <h1>VE and VJ Day 2025</h1>
            <p>2025 marks 80 years since the end of the Second World War, with Victory in Europe (VE)
              Day on 8 May 1945 and Victory over Japan (VJ) Day on 15 August 1945.</p>
              <hr width="80%" style="margin: 0 auto;" class="mb-3">
              <p>8 May 1945 – Victory in Europe Day (VE DAY) – is a day etched in the memory of everyone who witnessed
                it. After nearly six years of war Germany officially surrendered on 7 May 1945 and the conflict was finally
                over. The unconditional surrender came after Adolf Hitler took his own life on 30 April as the Allies
                surrounded Berlin, and was authorised by his successor Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. News that the war in
                Europe had ended did not come as a surprise and had been anticipated back in Britain for some time as
                the Allies advanced on Germany. </p>
                <p>
                A newsflash was broadcast to the public announcing the end of the war in Europe and that the next day
                was declared Victory in Europe (VE) Day (and a public holiday in the UK). Throughout the Allied world,
                millions celebrated. In Britain, pubs could stay open until late, and red, white and blue bunting could be
                bought without ration coupons. Streets were filled with singing and dancing, parties and parades. Special
                thanksgiving services were held.</p>
                <p>
                Yet the joy and relief were tempered by memories of the hundreds of thousands who had died, or were still
                missing, and concern for those still at war. Brutal fighting continued to rage in east Asia and the Pacific until
                August. More than 250,000 Allied Prisoners of War were liberated in Europe, and their repatriation home
                had to be organised.</p>
                <p>
                As the Allies swept across Europe, they uncovered the full horror of the network of concentration and
                forced labour camps and other locations where six million Jewish people and hundreds of thousands of
                others had been murdered. Genocide, war and forced population movements created more than 50 million
                refugees and displaced people in Europe. It would take many months and vast resources to care for and
                resettle these people.</p>
                <p>
                Yet after years of uncertainty and sacrifice, the people of Europe could face the new challenges of
                reconstruction and peace. The Second World War generation changed the course of history and
                commenced the rebuilding of an exhausted country in the post war years. These men and women
                defended the freedoms we enjoy today. We remember their service and sacrifice.</p>
